ðŸ“Š Data Scenario Projects â€“ End-to-End Practice with Realistic ML Tasks

This repository contains a collection of projects based on the "Data Scenario" YouTube playlist. Each video in the series presents a real-world machine learning or data science task, and Iâ€™ve recreated these projects step-by-step using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and other relevant libraries.

The aim of this series is to gain hands-on experience by applying machine learning techniques to practical scenarios â€” ranging from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model building, evaluation, and deployment concepts.

ðŸŽ¯ What This Series Covers
- Understanding and preparing real-world datasets
- Applying different ML models based on the task type
- Feature engineering and evaluation metrics
- Recommendation systems, classification, and clustering tasks
- Using similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) and embeddings
- Exploring user behavior and business context in data

ðŸ’¡ Why This Repository?
Each project in this repository is structured and documented to reflect how a real-world machine learning workflow would be handled â€” from raw data to insight or model. Itâ€™s also part of my personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of applied machine learning and data-driven thinking.
